Test TLS interoperability between LibreSSL and OpenSSL.

Implement a simple SSL server in C.  Create two binaries by linking
it with LibreSSL or OpenSSL.  This way API compatibility is tested.
Connect with our netcat to test protocol compatibility.

Currently OpenSSL 1.0.2p from ports is used.  Plan is to move to
OpenSSL 1.1 and and test TLS 1.3.
